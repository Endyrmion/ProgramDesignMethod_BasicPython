# 2. Write a program that calculates the average score on an exam. Assume we have a small class of only three students.
# Assign each studentâ€™s score to variables called student1, student2, and student3 and then use these variables to find the average score.
# Assign the average to a variable called average. Print the student scores and the average score.
# The following demonstrates the program output when the students have been assigned scores of 80.0, 90.0, and 66.5:
# Student scores:  80.0 90.0 66.5 Average: 78.83333333333333
