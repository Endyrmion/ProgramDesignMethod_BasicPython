After executing these statements: x = y y = x

what will the values of x and y be, respectively?
(c) 10 and 10

5. True or False: “x ** 2” yields the identical result that is produced
by “x * x” for all integer and float values of x.

TRUE

6. True or False: “x ** 2.0” yields the identical result that is produced
by “x * x” for all integer and float values of x.

 y = 4
 print("x", "y", x + y)

(b) x y 7


For each of the following, determine the value to which the expression evaluates.
(Your answer should distinguish between floats and ints by either the inclusion or exclusion of a decimal point.)

10. 5.5 - 11 / 2 : 0.0

11. 5.5 - 11 // 2 : 0.5

12. 10 % 7 : 3

13. 7 % 10 : 7

14. 3 + 2 * 2 : 7

15. 16 / 4 / 2 : 2.0

16. 16 / 4 * 2 : 8.0


17. Given that the following Python statements are executed:
a = 2
b = a + 1 // 2
c = a + 1.0 // 2
d = (a + 1) // 2
e = (a + 1.0) // 2
f = a + 1 / 2
g = (a + 1) / 2

Determine the values to which the variables b through g are set : 2

18. What output is produced when the following code is executed?
 hello = "yo"
 world = "dude"
 print(hello, world)

(b) yo dude

19. The following code is executed.
What is the output from the print() statement?
 x = 15
 y = x
 x = 20
 print(y)

(a) 15

20. The following code is executed.
What is the output from the print() statement?
result = "10" / 2 print(result)


(d) This produces an error.

21. The following code is executed.
 What is the output from the print() statement?
  x = 10
  y = 20
  a, b = x + 1, y + 2
  print(a, b)

(b) 11 22

22. True or False: In general, “x / y * z” is equal to “x / (y * z)”

FALSE

23. True or False: In general, “x / y ** z” is equal to “x / (y ** z)”.

TRUE

24. True or False: In general, “w + x * y + z” is equal to “(w + x) * (y + z)”.

FALSE

25. True or False: In general, “w % x + y % z” is equal to “(w % x) + (y % z)”.

TRUE

26. True or False: If both m and n are ints, then “m / n” and “m // n” both evaluate to ints.

FALSE

27. True or False: The following three statements are all equivalent:
 x = (3 + 4)
 x = 3 + \ 4
 x = """3 + 4""

FALSE

28. Given that the following Python statements are executed:
 x = 3 % 4
 y = 4 % 3

What are the values of x and y?
x = 3 && y = 1

29. To what value is the variable z set by the following code? z = 13 + 13 // 10

(d) 14

30. Assume the float variable ss represents a time in terms of seconds.
